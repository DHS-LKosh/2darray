# 2darray

Use the data below to solve the following questions.  The data represents a runnerâ€™s times over the month of February (that way the data works out nicely).
1. Represent the table as a 2D array.  There should be 7 columns and 4 rows.
2. Write a method to neatly display the data using printf statements.

4. Write a method that will find the average run in February.
5. Write a method that returns an integer that represents the day of the longest run.
6. Write a method that will print all the days that were breaks (Had miles run of 0).
